Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a master student in the Multi-Modal Artificial Intelligence System Laboratory of the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/). Before that, I got my bachelor from the Department of Computer in [North China Electric Power University](https://www.ncepu.edu.cn/). 

My research interest focuses on Deep Causal Learning, Causal Inference, Causal Discovery, Social Computing(e.g., Information Cascade, Social Resilience) and LLM Alignment.

You can find my CV here : [Zizhen'CV](../assets/CV_中文.pdf)

The focus of this homepage is "Research", which gives a detailed introduction of the research I have done and am doing.
