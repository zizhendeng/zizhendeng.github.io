Existing interpretability tools are often incapable of adapting to large language models with hundreds of millions of parameters, as they tend to focus on small models fine-tuned for specific tasks. In this study, we propose a novel approach based on causal abstraction theory and mixture of experts to find the neural representation corresponding to a given causal variable in the causal structure model. The highlights are as follows:
