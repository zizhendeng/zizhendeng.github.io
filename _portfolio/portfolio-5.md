Based on large-scale news media data, the research uses the cross-convergent mapping method to construct a causal network of influence among countries, and superimposes the influence network generated by the interaction degree to form a credible influence network. To our knowledge, this work is the first to apply causal inference to news media worldwide, measuring causal influence between countries.
