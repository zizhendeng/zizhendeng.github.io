Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a master student in the Multi-Modal Artificial Intelligence System Laboratory of the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from the department of computer science of [North China Electric Power University](https://www.ncepu.edu.cn/) in 2021. 

My research interest focuses on Deep causal learning, Causal inference, LLM Alignment and Social computing(e.g., information cascade, social resilience).

You can find my CV here : [CV](../assets/CV_En.pdf)

简历中文版：[简历](../assets/CV_中文.pdf)

The focus of this homepage is "Research", which gives a detailed introduction of the research I have done and am doing.
