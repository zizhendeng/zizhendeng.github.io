The research pointed out the existing problems and limitations in the field of causal learning, leading to the inevitability of combining with deep learning. Then introduce the latest methods in the three core directions of causal variable-oriented representation learning, deep causal discovery, and deep causal inference.

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first comprehensive survey of the combination of causal representation, causal discovery, causal inference and deep learning.

Contains classic and latest deep causal discovery and deep causal inference methods, such as NOTEARS, DAG-GNN, Grad-DAG; CFR, DragonNet, CEVAE, GANITE, DeepIV, etc.

We reveal mechanistically the improvements that deep learning brings to causal inference.<br/><img src='/images/Re_DCL_2.png'>
