Social resilience refers to the ability of a social system to adapt, recover and continue to develop in the face of pressure, shock, crisis or change. It measures the degree to which a community or society can maintain stability, reduce losses, and resume normal operations in the face of various challenges such as natural disasters, economic recession, political unrest, and technological innovation.

In social sciences, social resilience is a classic research problem. There are many factors that affect social resilience, and there are many calculation indicators. However, most of the existing methods are only weighted calculations of multiple statistical indicators, and there is no recognized efficient social resilience's calculation method.

We try to analyze from the essence that people are the most basic elements of society, and the most important manifestation of social resilience should be through people's feedback. This study introduces a cognitive network at the social level, which we call a social cognitive network. We use the causal discovery method to obtain the causal relationship between the various dimensions of social cognition to construct social cognition network. As a dynamic network, it collects data on various psychological, cognitive, and behavioral dimensions of society over a period of time. We use the network resilience of social cognitive networks to calculate the evolving trends and properties of social resilience.

Compared with other methods that directly weight and calculate various indicators, the social cognitive network, as a proxy research object of the social resilience system, can more thoroughly understand the changing laws and characteristics of social resilience from the perspective of dynamic evolution. The datasets used in this study are 4 Reddit topic datasets. Respectively recorded posts and comments on Reddit with tags bitcoin, GME, ethereum, covid. The data scales range from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions.

Core Process
------

1.Build a social cognitive network:

Use LIWC to extract information of each semantic dimension from Reddit posts or comments as the value of each cognitive dimension. Using the day as the unit, use the causal discovery method to obtain the causal relationship between various dimensions, and generate a cognitive causal map. Since different causal discovery methods have different scopes of application, different methods may obtain different results. This study tested a variety of causal discovery methods and selected a more stable method to apply to the global data. An example social cognitive network is shown below:

2.Calculate the network resilience and effective state of the social cognitive network, and explore what kind of dynamic paradigm the social cognitive system belongs to:
   
This part uses the GBB algorithm to simplify the multi-dimensional structure of network elasticity into a one-dimensional structure, so that it can be analyzed and described. Taking the Reddit_covid dataset as an example, we can see that the effective state of the social cognitive network bifurcates with the increase of the resilience coefficient. That is to say, there are two states in the social cognitive system, one maintains high activity and the other maintains low active.

3.Changes in social resilience over timeï¼š

4.The manifestation of various cognitive dimensions when social resilience is low:
   
  By observing the changes of various cognitive dimensions and social resilience over time, it is found that when social resilience is low, people's analytical thinking declines.

5.The impact of different disturbances on social resilience:

  There are three disturbances to the social cognitive network, which are to delete nodes (eliminate a certain cognitive dimension), delete edges (eliminate the association between two cognitive dimensions), Perturb the weights of all edges (the social environment has changed dramatically). By implementing the above three perturbations on the social cognitive network and observing the changes in the effective state, we found that deleting a certain cognitive dimension has the greatest impact on social resilience and is most likely to lead to social collapse.
