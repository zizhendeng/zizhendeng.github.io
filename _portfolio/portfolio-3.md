Exploring causal relationships among variables in an information cascade
---

In the process of dissemination of information, there are many factors (taking short videos as an example, such as the number of fans of the video publisher, video duration, tags, etc.) that will affect the final scale of information dissemination (number of loops, comments, likes).

We want to explore the causal relationship between these variables and the magnitude of the causal effect.

**Causal discovery determines the causal graph:**
